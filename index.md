## SELECTED WORK
### Unsupervised Neural Text Search using Retrieval-Augmented Language Modeling
Master thesis. Inspired by recent retrieval-augmented language models such as [REALM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08909){:target="_blank"} or [RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401){:target="_blank"}, the work investigates possibilities of using retrieval-augmented language modeling for self-supervised training of a transformer-based retriever. \[ [PDF](/assets/thesis_violacampos.pdf){:target="_blank"} \]

<!---### Spiking Networks for Event-Based Angular Velocity Regression 
Training of a Spiking Neural Network to predict the 3-DOF angular velocity of a rotating event camera from short event sequences. \[ [PDF](/assets/snn_angular_velocity.pdf){:target="_blank"} \| [code](https://gitlab.cs.hs-rm.de/vcampos/snn_angular_velocity){:target="_blank"} \]

### Object tracking with event cameras
Overview of current methods for event based tracking and implementation of a visual system which tracks moving objects using event based vision.
