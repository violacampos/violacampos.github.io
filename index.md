I am a master student in computer science, currently working on my thesis about Retrieval-Augmented Language Models. I am especially interested in Machine Learning, NLP and Computer Vision.

## Selected Projects
### Sentence Similarity with Retrieval-Augmented Language Model Pre-Training


### Spiking Networks for Event-Based Angular Velocity Regression 
Training of a Spiking Neural Network to predict the 3-DOF angular velocity of a rotating event camera from short event sequences. [PDF](/assets/small_integral_trees.pdf), [code](/assets/small_integral_trees_slides.pdf)

### Object tracking with event cameras
Overview of current methods for event based tracking and implementation of a visual system which tracks moving objects using event based vision.
[PDF](/assets/event_based_tracking.pdf), [code](https://gitlab.cs.hs-rm.de/vcampos/event_based_corner_tracker)

### Small Integral Trees
Development of a parallelized search algorithm for _Integral Trees_, connected, acyclic graphs whose adjacency matrix has only integral eigenvalues. [PDF](/assets/small_integral_trees.pdf), [Slides](/assets/small_integral_trees_slides.pdf)

### Homomorphic Encryption _2013_
State of the art in Fully Homomorphic Encryption and prototypical implementation of a homomorphic encryption scheme in sage and python. (bachelor thesis) [PDF](/assets/thesis.pdf), [Slides](/assets/fhe_slides.pdf)

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/violacampos/violacampos.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/violacampos/violacampos.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
